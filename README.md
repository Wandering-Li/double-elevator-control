# dula-elevator-control
dual elevator control system in VerilogHDL.

It's a course work for my undergraduate.

related development software: Altium Designer, Quartus

Here are some picture showing what I've done for the courese work

First, I designed the circut and pcb for the dual elevator control system:

Second, professor gave me a standard circut board, and I have to solder the components to the circuit board.

Third, accroding to the given circut, I have to develop a elevator control system uesing VerilogHDL
(dual-elevator control is a bonus assignment since it is pretty hard to use only one chip but not two, on the given circut. But I think it still achievable and managed to work it out to the best I can.)

final work shows in the gif

In general, this dual elevator controller is just like a normal double elevator. In any case, the elevator is capable of reasonable behavior. I put the code for the dual elevator control system in the file, along with a specification and inner logic explain.
